# Phone and desktop control

All commands run as the desktop user inside the Linux container. Output is JSON unless noted.

## Android-side device functions: `rungic-platform --request '<json>'`

The Android app that hosts the desktop answers these (it must be in the foreground; an error "请先返回 Plasma Mobile" means the user left the app).

| Request | Effect |
|---|---|
| `{"op":"status"}` | Android device status summary |
| `{"op":"network-get"}` | Wi-Fi / mobile network state |
| `{"op":"display-get"}` | phone display modes, refresh rate, render size |
| `{"op":"brightness-get"}` / `{"op":"brightness","value":0.5}` | read / set screen brightness (0.02-1, -1 = system) |
| `{"op":"clipboard-get"}` / `{"op":"clipboard-set","text":"..."}` | Android clipboard |
| `{"op":"orientation","mode":"portrait"}` | `system`, `portrait` or `landscape` |
| `{"op":"vibrate"}` | short vibration |
| `{"op":"settings","target":"network"}` | open an Android settings panel: `network`, `bluetooth`, `display`, `sound`, `datetime`, `location` |
| `{"op":"cast-desktop"}` / `{"op":"cast-desktop","enabled":true}` | whether a connected TV shows the Linux desktop (on by default; to connect a TV use `rungic-cast`) |
| `{"op":"cast-controls","mode":"touchpad"}` | phone as TV touchpad: `phone`, `touchpad`, `keyboard` |

Battery, CPU, memory and storage come from Linux: `upower -d`, `free -h`, `df -h /`, `/sys/class/power_supply/*`.

## TV casting: `rungic-cast`

Casting connects the phone to the TV over Wi-Fi Display; the TV then becomes the desktop's second screen (`CAST-1`). Run it yourself when the user asks to cast or stop casting ("投屏", "投到电视", "断开投屏").

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `rungic-cast connect` | connect the TV used last (about 5-10 s; up to a minute if the TV was just disconnected) |
| `rungic-cast connect "<name>"` | a specific TV, by name as `rungic-cast scan` lists it |
| `rungic-cast disconnect` | stop casting; windows return to the phone |
| `rungic-cast status` | `active_state` 2 = connected, `active.name`, `reconnecting` |
| `rungic-cast scan` | TVs in reach (about 8 s) |

- A failed connect prints `{"error": ...}`: run `rungic-cast scan`; if the TV is not listed, it is off or its screen-mirroring input is closed; say so.
- When the TV drops the session by itself, the phone reconnects automatically for up to three minutes (`reconnecting: true`). A disconnect by the user (this command, the quick-settings "投屏" button, Android's cast controls) is never reconnected.
- The quick-settings "投屏" button does the same by hand.

## Operating apps on screen: the `rungic-desktop` MCP tools (preferred)

Use these tools for anything on screen; they act with ordinary pointer/keyboard input, like the user's own hands. Every step is decided from **screenshots** (GPT-6 Luna computer use): no accessibility tree and no OCR, so any app works, whatever toolkit it uses.

**Which screen** (docs/research/91): the tools below act on one of two screens, and a result says where whenever that changes.
- **The user's desktop** while the user has it out: **desktop mode** (桌面模式, a full desktop on a second screen `CAST-n`, in a floating window on the phone) is on, or the TV shows the desktop (casting is desktop mode on the TV). The user is at that screen and may use it too. Apps open there, never on the phone's own screen (`WL-0`).
- Otherwise your own **workspace**, which the user sees as the **assistant's screen** (助理屏): one screen (`CAST-1`, 1920x1080), its own KWin, Xwayland and session bus, in a floating window on the phone or fullscreen. Whatever you open appears there from its first frame; the tools show it by themselves.
- `desktop_where {"target": "desktop" | "workspace" | "auto"}` when the user says where to work; it holds for this conversation. Without `target` it tells where you work and why.
- `rungic-agent-screen on|off|status|tv|notv` for the assistant's screen (`tv`: on the TV instead of the desktop). `rungic-desktop-mode on|off|status` for desktop mode: the user's, only when they ask. Your shell always runs in your workspace; `rungic-user <command>` runs a command in the user's session (a notification, say).

**Whole tasks: `desktop_goal` (preferred for anything that takes several steps).** Give the goal as the user said it, with every literal value in it, and the app: `{"goal": "在文件传输助手里发一条消息：今晚七点见", "app": "微信"}`. GPT-6 Luna then looks at the screen and decides every click, key and text (it types any language). Results: `outcome` (`done`, `question`, `failed`, `unfinished`, `stopped`), `achieved`, `answer` (what the screen shows about the goal), `steps`. Outcome `question`: ask the user `question`, then call again with the same goal and `replies: [{"question": ..., "answer": ...}]`. Ask the user before a goal that sends, pays, deletes or changes an account, and then say in the goal that it is confirmed.

**The user watches** (docs/88): the floating window shows a live caption of what is being done on the screen you work on (`desktop_goal` writes one per step by itself; give `desktop_act` a `note`), and it is spoken as progress. So do desktop-app work there, visibly, not headless.

**Look and act yourself** (a single known step, or checking a result):
- `desktop_screenshot` returns the active window on the screen you work on as an image (with its open menus and dialogs); `{"scope": "screen"}` for the whole screen (1920x1080).
- `desktop_act {"actions": [...], "note": "打开“渲染”菜单"}` carries out a short batch in that image's pixels and returns the new screenshot. Actions: `{"type": "click", "x": 700, "y": 400}` (`button` left/right, `keys` held modifiers), `double_click`, `move`, `drag` (`path` of points), `scroll` (`x`, `y`, `scroll_y` in pixels, positive = down), `keypress` (`keys`: `["CTRL", "L"]`, `["ENTER"]`), `type` (`text`, any language, into the focused field), `wait`.

**Windows** (the window manager, not the app; same in both plans):
1. `desktop_windows` - the open windows of your workspace and which one is active.
2. `desktop_launch {"app": "系统设置" | "org.kde.dolphin" | "Firefox"}` starts an app on the screen you work on and shows it; an app already open is brought forward instead of starting twice. `"args"` opens files or passes options in a new window: `{"app": "Koko", "args": ["/home/…/Pictures/a.png"]}`, `{"app": "Blender", "args": ["--python", "/home/…/make.py"]}` (a script run in the visible Blender: the user watches it build and render). `desktop_activate {"window_id": ...}` brings one to the front.
   - Most apps simply start an instance of their own in your workspace, whatever runs on the user's phone (Blender, Kalk, Dolphin ...). If the user has the same file open there, save your changes to a new file or tell them: nothing locks it.
   - An app that runs once per user (WeChat, a browser profile, Telegram) and is open on the user's phone has to move: `desktop_launch` (and `desktop_goal` with `app`) then returns `needs_confirmation` with a `question`. Ask the user exactly that and wait; only if they agree, call again with `"switch": true`. It is closed on the phone, opened in your workspace, and given back to the phone by itself about two minutes after your work ends. Never close the user's apps any other way (`kill`, `pkill`, `desktop_window`), and never during a call (`blocked: in_call`).
   - Close apps you opened in your workspace when you are done with them (`desktop_window` close): each costs the phone memory.
3. `desktop_window {"window_id": ..., "action": "close" | "minimize" | "maximize" | "restore"}`. The title bar belongs to the window manager: close windows this way. If `still_open` stays true after close, the app is asking something: look at it.
4. Start GUI apps with `desktop_launch`, not from the shell: it waits for the window, returns its id and opens it where you work (a program started from the shell opens in your workspace, also while you work on the user's desktop). If it reports no window, check `desktop_windows` once and tell the user instead of retrying other ways. Also prefer these tools over `kill` or similar for apps on screen.

**Plan two** (accessibility tree + OCR + JEV: `desktop_observe`, `desktop_run`, `desktop_find_name`) is not the default and its tools are not listed unless it was chosen (`rungic-cua plan atspi`, then the voice assistant restarts). Only when the user asks for it or it is active: read `plan-two.md` next to this file.

## Blender (3D models, rendering)

- Render with **Cycles on the CPU**. That is this phone's system default (docs/90): new scenes are Cycles on the CPU, and every render uses at most half the CPU cores so the phone stays usable; leave both as they are. Do not switch to EEVEE, a GPU device or pass `--gpu-backend` unless the user asks for GPU rendering: the GPU shares the phone's memory (EEVEE took about 0.9 GB more than Cycles for a small scene, and memory once ran out mid-render).
- Keep it light: render at **512×512** by default (the user's choice), 64 samples: about 20 s and 0.3 GB here (rungic_render does not denoise yet). Go larger (900 or more) only when the user asks for a bigger image; the time grows with the pixel count.
- Run it where the user watches, and render with `rungic_render` (a module of this phone's Blender, docs/90), never with `bpy.ops.render.render`:
  ```python
  import rungic_render
  rungic_render.render('/home/…/Pictures/篮球.png')   # the scene's Cycles samples, in passes
  ```
  Build the scene in the script, then call it (from a timer if the script runs at start: `bpy.app.timers.register(lambda: rungic_render.render(path) and None, first_interval=1)`), and start the script in the visible Blender: `desktop_launch {"app": "Blender", "args": ["--python", "/home/…/make.py"]}`.
  - The render runs in a background Blender, so the window stays responsive. Blender's render window on the screen you work on shows each pass as it comes (the picture sharpens: 4, 12, 28, 64 samples), and so does the task card in this chat, at the same time.
  - Wait for `<image>.status.json` to say `"phase": "done"` (or `"error"`) before you answer, e.g. `timeout 600 sh -c 'until grep -q "\"done\"\|\"error\"" /home/…/篮球.png.status.json; do sleep 2; done'`. Then show the image in your answer as `![…](<path>)`.
- "投到电视上看": connect the TV with `rungic-cast connect`; the TV shows the user's desktop, so you then work there (`desktop_where` says so). Working in your workspace with the render already on the assistant's screen, `rungic-agent-screen tv` puts that screen on the TV instead, render window included, with nothing to move.
- Never close or kill a Blender that shows "Not Responding" while it works; judge by the status file.

## WeChat (微信) on screen

WeChat exposes its controls; use these names instead of guessing (English UI names):

- Layout: a narrow window hides the chat list and its search box. On the TV WeChat opens desktop-sized; if the chat list (`list 'Chats'`) is missing, `desktop_window ... maximize` first.
- Open a chat: type into the text field named `Search` at the top of the chat list, then choose the person under `Contacts` in the results popup (or click the item in `list 'Chats'`, whose name starts with the chat's name, e.g. `File Transfer`). The navigation-bar button `Search` is WeChat's web search (搜一搜), not contact search.
- Names the user SAID are unreliable: speech recognition picks characters of the same sound (周凯文 for 周楷雯). Never search by the recognized characters: search the pinyin (`zhoukaiwen`; WeChat searches pinyin) and take the contact whose name sounds the same. `desktop_goal` does this by itself when the goal says the name came from speech; its `answer` names the contact actually opened. If two different people fit, or none, ask the user (say the names you found).
- The message box is the editable text named after the open chat (e.g. `周楷雯`). ENTER there sends. Check the chat header name first, and never type into it unless the goal is to send that text to that chat.
- In a chat: `Voice Call` (chat header), `Send Voice`, `Send File`, `Send`, `Chat Info`. `Voice Input (Hold Ctrl+Super)` is speech-to-text, not a voice message.
- Test on `File Transfer` (文件传输助手, messages go to the user's own devices), never on a real contact.

## Voice messages on the user's behalf (语音代发)

When the user asks you to send a voice message (发语音, 用语音告诉…):

1. Open the chat by the SOUND of the name with `desktop_goal` (`{"goal": "在微信里打开和周凯文的聊天（名字来自语音识别，按读音找），不要发送任何内容", "app": "微信"}`; see the WeChat section). Check the chat header in its `answer` shows that contact before sending. When you tell the user whom you sent it to, use the contact's real name (e.g. "发给了周楷雯").
2. The content is what the user asked to say. Begin it with a short note that the assistant sends it for the user, e.g. `我是凯文的 AI 助理，替他发一条语音：……`. Do not add anything the user did not ask for.
3. `desktop_voice_message {"text": ...}` with the chat open on the screen you work on: the model finds the record control on screen (WeChat: the round "Send Voice" icon right of the message box, not the microphone, which is dictation), the tool speaks once the app records from the Linux microphone, then the model presses send. Only this app's microphone is switched, for the recording; the user's real microphone is never sent. Under plan two the tool takes control names instead (`plan-two.md`).
4. Report that it was sent (the tool returns the length) and to whom.

## Calls on the user's behalf (通话代理)

Choose the transport from the user's request: **“打电话” means a SIM/telephone call; “打微信电话” means a WeChat voice call.** An explicitly named other app stays that app. Check capabilities to see whether that choice can work; never switch transports because another one is available, was used last time, or worked on an earlier device. If the requested contact/number is ambiguous, resolve that detail; do not ask the user to choose again when they already specified it.

1. Run `rungic-voice-agent --call-capabilities` in the current desktop session. This reads current backend/SIM/key prerequisites without dialing. Unreachable is not proof of unsupported hardware; interface availability is not proof the remote party can hear the agent. Consult the returned verification/capability fields and report a limitation when it affects the requested call. Do not hard-code a handset, host, SIM, test number, or a permanent lack of a feature into your decision.
2. Use `--start-call` for the requested transport, with the recipient and purpose the user authorized. It prepares Realtime before dialing. See [calls.md](calls.md) for parameters and controls. Do not click a dial button first or fabricate a contact's phone number.
3. A call appears as a **card in the originating voice-assistant conversation**, for both SIM and app calls. The card owns its status, transcript, questions, private text instructions, takeover/hang-up controls and final result. Leaving the assistant can keep a compact call bar; returning restores the card. Do not replace the card with a full-screen workflow.
4. `dialed: true` acknowledges the outgoing request, not connection or a successful conversation. Let the live call state and remote responses establish those. After starting, briefly tell the user which recipient and transport is calling, then let the call agent speak. On a timeout or lost connection inspect the existing call; never automatically redial or fall back to a different transport.

## Desktop windows and screenshots (shell)

- Screenshot of your workspace: `spectacle -b -n -f -o /tmp/shot.png`. Look at the image to understand what is on screen.
- To open a URL or file, launch the app with `desktop_launch` (`args` with the path or URL) and use `desktop_goal` or `desktop_act`.
- Send the user a notification: `rungic-user notify-send "标题" "内容"` (plain `notify-send` would stay in your workspace, where nobody reads it).
- Low-level AT-SPI tool for debugging only: `rungic-a11y` (apps/tree/find/act/text/windows).

## Screen recording

The quick-settings "录屏" button records the phone and, if cast, the TV (hardware H.264, files in `~/Videos`). There is no command-line trigger; tell the user to use the button.

## Rules

- Ask before changing brightness/orientation or casting state unless the user asked for it.
- Do not uninstall apps, delete user files or change system configuration without an explicit request.
